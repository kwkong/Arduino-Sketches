User Serial Functions:

Enable/Disable Sensor
	Enable/disable the detector

		Counter Sends a high on a status pin that allows the detector to enter the detect while loop.

Force Parcel Event
	Trigger high on signal pin to simulate a parcel event

		Detector artificially writes the signal (counter interrupt) pin high then low.

Query/Adjust Light Intensity
	Query/adjust PWM value to LED, to vary brightness

		Query: Return brightness Value as a percent

		Adjust: Prompt user to enter brightness value as a percent
				Reads percent and converts it to a corresponding PWM value.

Query/Adjust Sensor Sensitivity  //kind of pointless
	Query/adjust the analogRead threshold required to trigger a parcel event

		Query: Return sensor sensitivity threshold

		Adjust: Prompt user to enter new threshold
				Write new threshold to sensitivity variable

Query Time
	Query the system time to that of the main system

		Query: Uses get system time function
			   Returns reply


System Serial Functions:

Get System Time
	Request the time from the main system.

		Sends time request over serial to the main system, and stores response as the time. This is used when parcel event is being reported to the main system, and the time requested from the server included in the "report".

Report Parcel
	Sends information about a parcel event.

		Sends a "report" of the latest parcel event that was registered. Report includes the direction of the parcel, as well as the time that the event was registered.
